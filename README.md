Project Title: Design and Implementation of a 2D Game Using OpenGL

Short Description:

This project focuses on the design and development of a 2D game using the OpenGL graphics library. The game features a controllable main character capable of moving, jumping, and ducking within a dynamically scrolling environment that creates the illusion of continuous movement. Randomly generated platforms, coins, obstacles, and multiple types of enemies increase gameplay challenge and replayability. Collision detection and basic physics are implemented to manage player interactions with enemies and objects. The primary objective of the project is to demonstrate fundamental game development concepts such as real-time rendering, user input handling, physics simulation, and procedural content generation using OpenGL.
